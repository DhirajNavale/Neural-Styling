# Neural Style Transfer!

Implemented a  Neural Style Transfer  using **Tensorflow, Keras** and **StreamLit**. This project shows how a a neural network transforms the source image to target image at  multiple iterations. 
# Steps
1. User must select the target image  and a source image like a painting, design etc. 
2. Then select the epoch for how many times the model should run and at what iterations the converted image must be shown. And then click "Start" button.


## Requirements

TensorFlow = 2.1.0
Keras = 2.3.1
StreamLit = 0.70.0

To download use: `pip install requirement.txt`
